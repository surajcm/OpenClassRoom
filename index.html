		Hello everyone,
		The open class room project is about to create a software suite that can work as a class room on internet, it is a webportal in which any one can register as a student / teacher.
		An admin user selects and confirms the status of each teacher / student. And based on the subjects, teachers can schedule classes and students can register for them. Students and teachers can interact through 
		a live group chat.
		
		The software suite is still under development.
